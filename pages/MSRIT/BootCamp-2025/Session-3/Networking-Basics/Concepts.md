# **Networking Basics**

## **1. Introduction to Networking**
Networking is the process of connecting computers and other devices to share resources and information. It allows communication between devices over wired or wireless connections.

## **2. Types of Networks**
- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: A network within a small geographical area, such as an office or home.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: A network that covers a large geographical area, such as the internet.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: A network spanning a city or a large campus.
- **PAN (Personal Area Network)**: A small network for personal devices, such as Bluetooth connections.

## **3. Networking Devices**
- **Router**: Directs data between different networks and provides internet access.
- **Switch**: Connects multiple devices within a LAN and manages data traffic.
- **Hub**: Broadcasts data to all connected devices in a network.
- **Modem**: Converts digital signals into analog signals for internet access.
- **Access Point**: Provides wireless connectivity within a network.

## **4. IP Addressing**
- **IPv4**: 32-bit addressing (e.g., 192.168.1.1)
- **IPv6**: 128-bit addressing (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334)
- **Public IP**: Used on the internet, assigned by ISPs.
- **Private IP**: Used within a local network (e.g., 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x)

## **5. Networking Protocols**
- **TCP/IP**: Ensures reliable data transmission over networks.
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: Used for web browsing; HTTPS is encrypted.
- **FTP**: Transfers files between computers.
- **DNS**: Converts domain names into IP addresses.
- **DHCP**: Assigns IP addresses dynamically.

## **6. Network Topologies**
- **Star**: All devices connect to a central switch/router.
- **Bus**: All devices share a single communication line.
- **Ring**: Devices are connected in a circular path.
- **Mesh**: Every device connects to every other device.

## **7. Basic Network Commands**
- `ping`: Checks connectivity to another device.
- `ipconfig` (Windows) / `ifconfig` (Linux): Displays network configuration.
- `tracert` (Windows) / `traceroute` (Linux): Shows the path data takes to a destination.
- `netstat`: Displays network connections and statistics.
- `nslookup`: Checks DNS resolution.

## **8. Conclusion**
Networking is essential for communication in the digital world. Understanding the basics of network types, devices, protocols, and troubleshooting commands helps in setting up and managing networks effectively.
